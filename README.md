# KNX_ESP_Gateway

This project is an attempt to extend a KNX building automation network with WLAN/BLE clients.
This is done in 2 parts :
1. a KNX - WLAN/BLE gateway built around a KNXaim  and ESP32 : this relays the KNX messages via WLAN or BLuetooth towards wireless clients.
2. WLAN/BLE clients : the wireless client itself
